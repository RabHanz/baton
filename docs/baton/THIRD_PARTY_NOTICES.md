# Third-party notices

Code in Baton adapted from other projects, with their licences. Each entry names the files that
carry the adapted code.

## farzaa/clicky (MIT)

Commit `a80fa80721a8`. Adapted: the companion prompt and the `[POINT:x,y:label:screenN]` tag, its
parser, the screenshot-pixel to display coordinate maths, the 1280 px capture size, and the
pointer's triangle and quadratic-bezier flight. In `packages/baton-shared/src/screenCompanion.ts` and
`apps/desktop/src/baton/screen/pointerOverlay.ts`.

## Bitshank-2338/clicky-windows (MIT)

Commit `6c6216b7f80a`. Adapted: Drive's plan shape, `validate_plan`, the stop-on-mouse-movement
and stale-screen rules, and the "next"/"stop" phrases. In
`packages/baton-shared/src/screenCompanion.ts`. Its PyQt6 interface (GPL-3.0) is not used.

## cjpais/Handy and handy-computer crates (MIT)

Handy commit `7bfb2e2c934b`. Adapted: the Windows reliable paste (`src-tauri/src/paste_tx/`) in
`native/baton-dictation/src/paste_windows.rs`, the paste chords in `keys.rs`, and the pinned Parakeet
revision and hash in `apps/desktop/src/baton/voice/voiceModels.ts`. Used as dependencies:
`transcribe-cpp` 0.4.1, `handy-recorder` 0.1.0, `handy-keys` 0.3.4 (each MIT; transcribe.cpp vendors
ggml, Silero VAD and miniz, all MIT). The Handy name and brand assets are not used.

## Speech and wake models

- Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3 (NVIDIA, CC BY 4.0), GGUF conversion `handy-computer/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-gguf`,
  downloaded on first use.
- Pocket TTS (Kyutai, MIT) binary, and its weights and VCTK-derived voices (CC-BY-4.0), downloaded on
  first use from `kyutai/pocket-tts-without-voice-cloning`.
- `melspectrogram.onnx`, `embedding_model.onnx` from openWakeWord v0.5.1, `silero_vad.onnx` from
  Silero VAD v6.2.3 (MIT), shipped in `native/baton-dictation/models`. See
  `docs/baton/research/voice-stack-2026-10-26.md` for their licence notes.
- `sebastian.onnx`, `alfred.onnx`, `freya.onnx`, `onyx.onnx`: trained here (D98) on Piper's LibriTTS
  and en_GB voices (VCTK, aru, semaine, alba, jenny_dioco, northern_english_male,
  southern_english_female) with openWakeWord's published negative features. Those sets carry their own
  terms, some non-commercial. Check them before any packaged or commercial release.
- Fonts bundled in the window (inline, `apps/desktop/src/baton/home/fonts.ts`, Latin subset), both SIL
  Open Font License 1.1, texts in `docs/baton/licences/`: Newsreader (roman and italic, variable
  weight; Copyright 2020 The Newsreader Project Authors) and Schibsted Grotesk (variable weight;
  Copyright 2023 The Schibsted-Grotesk Project Authors).

## What ships, and under which licence (checked by CI)

`docs/baton/notices.json` lists every dependency, crate, model file and font that Tessaya's own code ships or downloads, and
`scripts/baton/check-notices.mjs` (run by the `verify` job) fails when one is missing here or has no licence text. Upstream T3
Code's own dependencies are covered by `third-party-licenses.config.json`. Licence texts are in `docs/baton/licences/`.

### Runtime

- **Electron** (MIT, Copyright (c) Electron contributors; Copyright (c) 2013-2020 GitHub Inc.), `licences/MIT-electron.txt`.
  Electron's own bundled components (Chromium, Node.js, FFmpeg and others) carry their licences in the `LICENSES.chromium.html`
  file Electron places beside the executable, which the installer keeps.
- **ONNX Runtime**, as `onnxruntime-node` (MIT, Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation), runs the wake and VAD models.
- **Rust crates** in `native/baton-dictation`: `transcribe-cpp`, `handy-recorder`, `handy-keys` (MIT, handy-computer);
  `enigo` (MIT); `hound` (Apache-2.0); `serde` and `serde_json` (MIT OR Apache-2.0); `windows-rs`, the `windows` crate
  (MIT OR Apache-2.0, Microsoft). Texts: `licences/MIT.txt`, `licences/Apache-2.0.txt`.
- **whisper.cpp** (MIT, Copyright (c) Georgi Gerganov) is the fallback speech-to-text binary where it is used.

### Models

| File | What it is | Licence | Ships in the installer |
| ---- | ---------- | ------- | ---------------------- |
| `silero_vad.onnx` | Silero VAD v6.2.3, Silero Team | MIT | yes |
| `melspectrogram.onnx` | openWakeWord v0.5.1 feature model | CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (the project's README groups it with its pre-trained models) | yes |
| `embedding_model.onnx` | openWakeWord v0.5.1 embedding model (the README says it re-implements Google's speech embedding, Apache-2.0) | CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, as above | yes |
| `sebastian.onnx`, `alfred.onnx`, `freya.onnx`, `onyx.onnx` | Tessaya's wake models, trained here with openWakeWord's trainer | trained on sets that include non-commercial data (below), so treated as CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 | yes |
| Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3 (NVIDIA), GGUF conversion by handy-computer | speech to text for dictation | CC BY 4.0 | no, downloaded on first use |
| Pocket TTS (Kyutai) binary and weights; VCTK-derived voices | spoken replies | MIT (binary); CC BY 4.0 (weights and voices) | no, downloaded on first use |

Texts: `licences/CC-BY-4.0.txt`, `licences/CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0.txt`, `licences/MIT.txt`. A clean-licence wake model for the word
Tessaya is trained on the sets marked "clean" below (`WAKE_TRAINING_CLEAN.md`); the four older words are not.

### Training data for the wake models

CC BY terms require attribution; this is it. The licence of each set is as recorded when it was chosen and should be checked
against the set's own page before a release that relies on it.

| Data | Used for | Licence |
| ---- | -------- | ------- |
| VCTK corpus (University of Edinburgh) voices through Piper | positives, old and clean | CC BY 4.0 |
| ARU voice set through Piper | positives, old and clean | CC BY 4.0 |
| Alba voice through Piper | positives, old and clean | CC BY 4.0 |
| Cori voice through Piper | positives, clean | public domain |
| LibriTTS-R (Google) generator | American top-up positives | CC BY 4.0 |
| LibriSpeech (Panayotov et al.), train-clean-100, dev and test-clean | negative features and validation, clean | CC BY 4.0 |
| MUSAN (Snyder, Chen, Povey) noise and music | background audio and held-out noise, clean | CC BY 4.0 |
| MIT environmental impulse responses (McDermott lab) | room impulses | as published by the lab (recorded here as MIT) |
| Semaine, jenny_dioco, northern_english_male, southern_english_female voices; AudioSet clips; openWakeWord's ACAV100M features | old path only | include non-commercial or per-item terms; the reason the four older wake models are not cleared for commercial use |
| Piper TTS | generating the positives | MIT (the version used at training time is to be confirmed) |

### Fonts

Newsreader (roman and italic, variable weight; Copyright 2020 The Newsreader Project Authors) and Schibsted Grotesk (variable
weight; Copyright 2023 The Schibsted-Grotesk Project Authors) are bundled in the window, SIL Open Font License 1.1, texts in
`licences/OFL-newsreader.txt` and `licences/OFL-schibsted-grotesk.txt`. The fonts are not sold on their own and keep their names
and licence.
