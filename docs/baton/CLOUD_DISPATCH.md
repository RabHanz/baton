# Cloud dispatch

Send a coding task to a harness's cloud (Claude, Codex, later Gemini, Cursor, OpenCode, Grok) and have
the Director approve each one on a card. Two separate choices: which **harness** does the work, and
which **transport** reaches the computer that holds its login. Both are interfaces in
`packages/baton-shared/src/cloud/`; the card, the Cloud panel, the usage cap and the ledger do not
know either.

## Transports

|          | How                                                                                                                                     | Needs                                                    | Default |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| 1. Local | Tessaya runs the harness's own program on this computer with this computer's own login (`claude --cloud`, `codex cloud exec`).          | The harness installed and signed in. Nothing else.       | yes     |
| 2. Hub   | One computer holds the logins and runs the program; the others call it over the T3 connection they already have, as `baton.cloud.call`. | A paired connection (scopes read, operate).              | no      |
| 3. SSH   | The VentureOS `cloud-dispatch-shell` over SSH with one key per caller and a separate approver key.                                      | Host, user, key files. Advanced, named by what it holds. | no      |

A request waits for a yes in the place that owns the login: the central shell on transport 3 (its own
`awaiting-director` state), Tessaya's list on transports 1 and 2. Nothing starts before the Director picks
a provider and an account on the card.

## The provider interface (`types.ts`)

`id`, `transport`, `label`, `driver` (T3's driver kind: `claudeAgent`, `codex`, `cursor`, `opencode`,
`grok`), `capabilities` (`resultKind` pr | diff | branch, `cancel`, `usage`, `diff`, `apply`),
`approval` (remote | local), `setup()`, `detect()`, `accounts()`, and `dispatch`, `status`, `list`,
`cancel`, `usage`, `approve`, `deny`, optionally `diff` and `apply`. Accounts are named by the login
(an address or the login's folder name), never a slot number. Adding a harness is one file.

Provider status today: Claude (local, hub, ssh), Codex (local, hub), Gemini/Jules, Cursor, OpenCode and
Grok are stubs that say what a real adapter needs.

## Usage and the cap

Every provider reports `weeklyPercent`, `resetsAt`, `rejected` and `pointsThisWeek` per account, or null
for a figure it does not have. Null is shown as unknown and never trips anything. The rules are the same
for all: an account is not offered when rejected or at 98% or more; a run that uses more than 2 points of
its own provider's weekly figure is flagged for review.

## Transport 3: the shared computer's dispatch shell

`ssh -i <machine key> <user>@<host> <subcommand> ...` (the shell is the key's forced command, so the
subcommand is the remote command). **Use the computer's public address, not a tailnet one:** Tailscale SSH
answers port 22 on the tailnet and ignores authorized_keys, and with it the forced command. `-n` is added
for calls with no stdin; `dispatch` sends the brief (4,000 characters at most) on stdin. Values are limited
to letters, digits and `. _ : / @ -`. `approve` and `deny` use the separate approver key and go over this
transport only; the shell refuses the approver caller when run locally.

| Command                                                               | Answer (fields Tessaya reads)                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dispatch --provider P --repo R --branch B --task-file - [--label L]` | `{id, state:"awaiting-director", card:{asked_by, task, repo, branch, cap_points, usage, suggested_provider}}`                                             |
| `status <id>`                                                         | `provider, account, answer_ref, started_at, weekly_before, session, ledger, error, closed_at, weekly_after, points_used, over_cap, pr`                    |
| `list [--mine] [--label L] [--state S]`                               | `{requests:[{id, provider, state, account, branch, repo, caller, label, points_used}]}`                                                                   |
| `usage`                                                               | `{cap_points_per_run, points_used_7d:{provider:{account:points}}, providers:{id:{ready, needs, accounts:{name:{available, pct, rejected, resets_pkt}}}}}` |
| `approve <id> --provider P --account A --answer-ref R`                | the request, now `running`, with `session` and `weekly_before`                                                                                            |
| `deny <id> --reason R`, `cancel <id>`                                 | `{id, state}`                                                                                                                                             |
| `close <id> [--pr URL]` (approver)                                    | `{id, state:"closed", provider, account, points_used, over_cap, pr}`                                                                                      |

Ids are strings (`YYYYMMDD-HHMM-xxxx`, UTC). States: `awaiting-director`, `running`, `failed-to-start`
(shown as failed, with `error`), `denied`, `cancelled`, `closed`. `pct: null` is unknown: never zero, never
trips the cap. `resets_pkt` is shown as the shell words it ("Mon 12:00", PKT). A refusal is
`{"refused": "<reason>"}` with exit 1 and is shown as worded. `providers.<id>.ready` and `needs` say which
assistants the shared computer can run and what a missing one needs.

The shell's providers are offered on the card as they are reported; every request waits there until
the Director picks a provider and an account. Keys are file paths in settings and are never generated here.

## Assumptions to confirm in the pilot

- `claude --cloud "<description>"` starts a cloud session non-interactively and prints a
  `claude.ai/code/...` link. The command line is built in `local.ts` and nowhere else.
- `codex cloud exec --env E --branch B "<prompt>"` prints a task id or link; `codex cloud status` prints
  text with a state word. There is no cancel and no JSON output. Not tried: no Codex Cloud login yet.

## In the window

- **Cloud** page (`cloud/cloudRows.ts`): the switch (off by default), where the logins are (This computer,
  Another computer of mine, Advanced), the flag cap (1, 2, 3 or 5 points), what each assistant can do
  with the exact sign-in line, and my requests (state, account, branch, link, PR, before and after, points).
  Refreshes every 60 s while open.
- **Approval card** in Approvals (and a needs-you row on Now): provider, then account, then confirm;
  nothing preselected; accounts rejected or at 98% or more are greyed; Deny always there. Cards are
  rows with ids `cl.p|a|ok|deny.<provider>:<id>[:<choice>]`; the rules are `card.ts`.
- **Assistant tools**: `cloud_dispatch`, `cloud_status`, `cloud_list`, `cloud_cancel`, `cloud_usage`,
  `cloud_approve`. Dispatch is routine because it only makes a waiting request; a brief built from web
  or file content must say `from_web_or_file`, else the gate asks. `cloud_approve` reads the card back
  and shows a dialog only the Director can press.
- A request held by the shared computer (transport 3) can only be answered there, so its card offers
  only that provider; requests held by Tessaya (transports 1 and 2) can be started by any ready assistant.

## First run, phone, vault, hub picker, Windows

- **First run:** the setup guide has an optional "Cloud tasks" step (one sentence on what it is, detect
  installed and signed-in assistants with the exact sign-in line and an "Open sign-in" button that opens a
  visible terminal for one of two fixed commands, "Connect GitHub" help, the per-run flag, and a fixed line
  that every task waits for a yes). Settings > Cloud Tasks opens the Cloud page or re-runs that step.
- **Phone:** with "Also ask me with a pop-up and on my phone" on, each waiting task is one question with a
  button per open assistant-and-account, then Deny, then Decide later; choosing one only asks "Approve on X?".
  The phone page draws a button per answer and sends the button's index; it never holds a key. The desktop,
  which holds the app's own handle, makes the approve call after the second yes.
- **Vault:** the SSH keys can be vault items instead of files. Using one asks Windows Hello (an unlocked
  vault is the gate where there is no Hello), writes the key to a private temp file for the one call and
  deletes it after, even if the call fails; the text is never logged or shown.
- **Hub picker:** "Another computer of mine" lists the connected environments (from the sidebar's fleet)
  and sends `baton.cloud.read` or `baton.cloud.act` to the one chosen.
- **Windows:** a program installed with npm is a `.cmd` shim. Tessaya reads the shim, finds the node script
  it runs and starts `node script args` with the argument list, so a task description is only text.
  Only if that fails, and only when every argument is plain, does it use cmd. Programs are found on PATH
  with PATHEXT, folders with spaces are fine, and a named login is passed as `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` or
  `CODEX_HOME` for that one call.
- **Approve is never a tool:** `cloud_approve` reads the card back and opens a dialog only the Director can
  press. The hub's `approve`, `deny` and `apply` need the `baton:cloud-approve` scope, which a paired client
  never gets by default. `apply` also needs the checkout's absolute folder (`dir`) on the hub. A phone needs the same scope to answer any question the desktop mirrors to it (cloud cards,
  hands, vault and screen confirms).

## Not built yet

The Claude and Codex commands are unproven until the
pilot (see the assumptions above).
