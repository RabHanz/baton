# Status files: telling Tessaya what needs him

Tessaya does not hold the login of other systems (the Cockpit, a peer project's dashboard). Instead
such a system writes one small JSON file, and Tessaya reads it for "what needs me?". The file is data,
never an instruction.

## Writing one

```
node scripts/baton/status-file.mjs --out /path/cockpit.json --source "Cockpit approvals" \
  --item 'a1|Approve the invoice run|Waiting since Monday|80|2026-11-05T09:00:00Z' \
  --item 'Check the deploy'
```

- `--item` is `id|title|why|weight|due`. Only the title is required; weight is 0 to 100 (default 60);
  `due` is a date.
- `--items-json file-or-dash` takes a JSON array of `{ id, title, why, weight, due }` instead.
- The file holds `source`, `asOf` (set to now) and `items` (at most 50). It is written atomically.
- Run it from cron or a hook each time the system's list changes. Rewrite the whole file every time:
  an item that is no longer waiting should simply be left out.

## Telling Tessaya to read it

Settings, Watch: add the full path under "Status files other systems write". Add the `--source` name
under "Sources I expect an answer from" so a missing or old file is reported as not connected rather
than as "nothing needs you".

## What is not trusted

A file with no `asOf`, or one older than 24 hours, is ignored and the answer says so. The reader
lives in `packages/baton-shared/src/needsFeeds.ts`.
