/**
 * Keeps each work session's Working Synopsis current, from the orchestration
 * event log alone.
 *
 * §11.1's deterministic triggers, mapped onto the events T3 actually emits:
 *
 * | §11.1 trigger            | orchestration event            |
 * | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
 * | turn completed           | `thread.turn-diff-completed`   |
 * | file changed             | `thread.turn-diff-completed`   |
 * | test started / completed | `thread.activity-appended`     |
 * | approval requested       | `thread.activity-appended`     |
 * | provider question        | `thread.activity-appended`     |
 * | plan step changed        | `thread.activity-appended`     |
 * | background started/stop  | `thread.session-set`           |
 * | PR opened                | `thread.pull-request-linked`   |
 *
 * A turn *starting* comes from `thread.message-sent`, which carries the user's
 * words; `thread.turn-start-requested` carries only ids.
 *
 * §11 allows semantic summarisation at milestones, and since D51 this reactor
 * does it — at exactly one milestone, a completed turn, and at most once per
 * turn. Everything else stays assembled from events: the model writes the two
 * sentences that say where the work is and what is needed, and decides nothing.
 * `needsUser` in particular remains derived, because a model guessing "needs
 * approval" is a model deciding whether to interrupt a person.
 *
 * When no account here can write one — no provider, a driver without the
 * capability, a failed call — the deterministic synopsis stands. It is the
 * older, plainer answer, and it is never wrong about the facts.
