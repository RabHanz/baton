/**
 * What a rule is allowed to do when it fires.
 *
 * Deliberately a small, named surface rather than "the reactor can reach the
 * orchestration engine". A rule can start a provider session, message the
 * active implementation thread, and record a notification. It cannot archive,
 * delete, settle, push, or touch anything outside its own work session, and
 * the way to keep that true is for the list to be short and to live in one
 * file.
 *
 * Every thread a rule creates goes through upstream's own launch service (via
 * `BatonEngine`), the path a client's new thread takes, and is attached to the work session with `origin: created`, so the timeline
 * shows that a rule made it rather than a person.
