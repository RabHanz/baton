/* oxlint-disable t3code/no-low-value-comments -- Baton file predating upstream's rule (D82) */
/**
 * Baton's own database: `userdata/baton.sqlite`, beside upstream's `statev2.sqlite`.
 *
 * Upstream owns its file, its migration table and its number space; Baton owns this one (the
 * port plan's "Data" section). Baton's repositories are built against this client only, so
 * upstream's `SqlClient` never sees a Baton table and Baton never patches upstream's Sqlite layer.
 *
 * First boot of the ported build seeds it from the pre-v2 `state.sqlite`, which still holds
 * Baton's seven `fabric_*` tables (D71 kept the names): the legacy file is opened read-only,
 * copied with `VACUUM INTO`, and everything that is not Baton's is dropped from the copy. The
 * legacy file is never written, so rolling back to a pre-v2 build keeps working.
