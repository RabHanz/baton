/**
 * The model read of a sentence the grammar could not place (D50).
 *
 * The Director's ruling was blunt: *"don't dumb it down by generic grammar!
 * what the hell even is the point of this if it isn't smart or sentient!"* This
 * is the answer to that, and it is deliberately the *second* answer:
 *
 *   grammar → learned phrasing → model
 *
 * The grammar stays first because it is instant, free and identical every time,
 * and it stays as the verifier because everything a model returns is checked
 * against the same ids and the same §24.1 list the grammar uses
 * (`@t3tools/shared/batonIntentModel`).
 *
 * Three rules this service follows, and they are the whole design:
 *
 *   1. **It runs as one of the user's own accounts.** The call goes through the
 *      same `TextGeneration` path as thread titles and commit messages, which
 *      spawns their `claude` CLI under their config directory. Subscription,
 *      not API — the Director's rule 2 — and no key of ours anywhere.
 *   2. **It uses the cheapest tier that can classify.** Haiku reads a sentence
 *      against a list of names; the model tier that writes code is not needed
 *      to decide whether "poke the scheduler" is a message or a status
 *      question.
 *   3. **It never reaches a provider that is not there.** No available account
 *      is a refusal by name, not a hang.
