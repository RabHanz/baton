/**
 * Everything Baton adds to the server, as two layers the server mounts at one point each
 * (`vendor-patches/t3code/0002-server-hooks.patch`):
 *
 * - `services`: work sessions, rules, intents, adopted sessions, the account pool, the engine
 *   seam and the one-shot model, with Baton's repositories on Baton's own database.
 * - `workers`: the reactors that follow upstream's events (synopsis, rules) and the account
 *   rotation tick, started the way upstream starts `PullRequestSyncReactor`.
 *
 * Later entries provide to earlier ones, so the order below is the dependency order.
