/**
 * D7, as a test rather than a promise.
 *
 * Baton's rollback story is not a `down` migration — the migrator has none —
 * it is that **every Baton migration is additive**, so a build from before it
 * opens the database, ignores what it does not know, and runs. That has been
 * rehearsed by hand after every phase. This asserts it, so the next migration
 * cannot quietly break it.
 *
 * What "additive" means here, precisely: create tables, create indexes, and add
 * columns to tables Baton itself owns. Never drop, never rename, never alter a
 * column an older build reads.
