/* oxlint-disable t3code/no-low-value-comments -- Baton file predating upstream's rule (D82) */
/**
 * Baton's migrations, in their own number space and their own tracking table.
 *
 * Why this is separate from `Migrations.ts`
 * ----------------------------------------
 * Upstream's manifest is a single ascending list, and the migrator runs exactly
 * the entries whose id is greater than the highest id recorded in the table —
 * anything at or below it is **silently skipped**. Baton's first six
 * migrations were numbered 054–059 inside that list, which put this fork on a
 * collision course with upstream's next migration: the moment upstream adds its
 * own 054, one of two things happens and both are bad. Merged into our
 * manifest, two entries claim the same id and the migrator fails with
 * `Duplicates`. Renumbered around ours, upstream's new migration sits below our
 * highest applied id and never runs at all — the schema silently diverges and
 * the first symptom is a query against a column that was never added.
 *
 * Putting Baton's migrations in a second manifest with `table:
 * "fabric_sql_migrations"` removes the shared number space entirely. Upstream's
 * list stays byte-identical to theirs, so the file most likely to conflict on
 * every sync stops conflicting; Baton numbers from 1 again and can add
 * migrations without caring what upstream did. Nothing in upstream's migrator
 * had to be reshaped — `MigratorOptions.table` is theirs, and it exists for
 * exactly this.
 *
 * See the maintainers' decision log D48.
