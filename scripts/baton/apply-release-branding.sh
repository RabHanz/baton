# Build-time-only branding override for the Baton desktop release pipeline
# (.github/workflows/baton-desktop-release.yml). Run ONLY inside that
# workflow's ephemeral checkout, right before the build. It is never run
# against, and never commits to, the working tree that gets pushed anywhere.
#
# Why this exists instead of a normal source edit: scripts/build-desktop-artifact.ts,
# apps/desktop/package.json and apps/desktop/src/app/DesktopEnvironment.ts carry
# upstream T3 Code's own desktop identity (appId com.t3tools.t3code, productName
# "T3 Code (Beta)", app name "T3 Code"). Installing an unpatched Baton build
# would collide with a Director machine's real T3 Code install: same NSIS
# registry key (from appId+productName) overwrites it, and the app would share
# its userData folder. Patching those constants here, at release-build time
# only, keeps the three files byte-identical to upstream in every other build
# (dev, CI, auto-sync) and avoids a permanent merge-conflict magnet. See
# docs/baton/UPSTREAM.md "Release build overrides (not a source edit)".
