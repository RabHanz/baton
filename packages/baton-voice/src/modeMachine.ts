/**
 * §12.3's voice modes as a pure reducer. No audio, no clock, no I/O: every
 * event carries its own time, so the whole thing is replayable in a test.
 *
 *   sleeping ──wake──▶ command_window ──utterance──▶ conversation
 *        ▲                    │ timeout                 │ timeout / "that's all"
 *        └────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘
 *   (base) direct_session when enabled: plain speech goes to the focused session
 *   dictation: entered by "dictate", left only by "stop dictating"
 *
 * Rules this enforces:
 *   - Without a wake (or an explicit activation) nothing said is acted on,
 *     except in direct-session mode, which the user switched on.
 *   - Follow-ups in conversation inherit the target the last command resolved
 *     to; no repeated wake phrase.
 *   - Dictation is a separate effect kind from commands and session messages,
 *     so dictated words can never be routed to an agent by accident.
 *   - A pending confirmation is answered only by a later, separate utterance
 *     inside the window. The wake word alone is stripped before that check, so
 *     "hey jarvis" can never be the "yes".
