/**
 * Where the user is, and what can be typed into.
 *
 * §15's desktop context bus, §16's VS Code report, §17's browser report and
 * §18's injection abstraction share one shape, because they answer one
 * question: **which target does this sentence belong to?** §14's ladder is only
 * as good as the facts under it, and every rung above "the user said so" is a
 * fact some producer has to report.
 *
 * Two rules constrain this contract, and both are privacy rules rather than
 * engineering ones:
 *
 *   1. **This is client-local.** §15 says a local authenticated IPC interface,
 *      not a public network API, and nothing here crosses the environment
 *      boundary. The environment learns the *resolved target* — a work session
 *      id — and never the window titles, page origins or field contents that
 *      produced it.
 *   2. **No page content.** §17 is explicit: the browser reports whether the
 *      focused element is editable, what kind of field it is, and where the tab
 *      is — never the text around it. A field label is optional and exists for
 *      the read-back ("insert into Gmail's compose box"), not for context.
