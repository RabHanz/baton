/**
 * One chronological answer to "what happened to this work, and who asked".
 *
 * Baton writes three kinds of record in their own tables for their own
 * reasons: intents (a person said something), firings (a rule did something),
 * and provider sessions (an account was attached or released). The Record is
 * the fourth source and the only table written just to remember: assistant
 * turns, a job's phase changes, a session that died and whether it came back,
 * a message between sessions. None of those had a durable home before, so it
 * duplicates nothing and cannot drift from a table that already says it.
 *
 * The audit view is a merge, a pure function over records the caller already
 * has. Every text in it was written by a person, a model or a session, so it is
 * quoted as data when shown to a model and never read as an instruction.
 *
