# Tessaya

Tessaya is a desktop assistant for people who work with coding agents. You talk or type; it looks at your screen when you ask, runs jobs in the background, remembers what you teach it, keeps your secrets in an encrypted vault, and asks before anything that matters. A web page on your own server puts the approvals and jobs on your phone.

It is built on [T3 Code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code) (a GUI and server for Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode and others), kept as a named patch series over a pinned upstream commit. The root `README.md` is upstream's; this page is Tessaya's.

## Licensing

Tessaya is open core, and this repository holds the product: everything a person running Tessaya needs. Our own operations (deploys, our machines, internal decisions, the hosted tier) live in a separate private repository, and nothing here depends on it.

Two licences apply, by who wrote the code:

- **T3 Code**, the base this is built on, stays under its MIT licence (`LICENSE` at the root). That covers every upstream file, including the ones our patch series (`vendor-patches/t3code/`) edits.
- **Tessaya's own code** is under the [Functional Source License 1.1, Apache 2.0 future licence](https://fsl.software) (FSL-1.1-ALv2). You may use, change and share it for anything except a product that competes with Tessaya, and each version becomes Apache 2.0 two years after its release. It covers the folders that carry their own `LICENSE`: `packages/baton-contracts`, `packages/baton-shared`, `packages/baton-voice`, `apps/desktop/src/baton`, `apps/server/src/baton`, `native/baton-dictation`, `scripts/tessaya` and `assets/baton`, plus Tessaya's files elsewhere (the `Baton*` and `baton*` files under `apps/web` and `apps/mobile`).

Third-party notices are in `docs/baton/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

## Install

Releases are on the [Releases page](../../releases): a Windows installer (first class), a macOS dmg (arm64) and a Linux AppImage. macOS and Linux start and run the voice but have fewer features; `docs/baton/PLATFORMS.md` says exactly what works where, and what was only seen in CI.

Builds are unsigned for now, so macOS shows a first-run warning and Windows SmartScreen may too.

Then read [Getting started](../docs/user/getting-started.md).

## Build

```bash
vp i
vp run dev          # server and web, with a seeded copy of your data
vp run check:changed
```

Desktop packaging: `scripts/tessaya/release-build.sh` and `.github/workflows/baton-desktop-release.yml`. The dictation sidecar is in `native/baton-dictation` (Rust). Details: `docs/operations/development.md`.
